    <h2>Longevity and Legacy:</h2>
    <p>Dental implants are sort of a blessing, bidding farewell to short-term perks and doing away with all bad habits. However, the most important unseen advantage of dental implants is that they improve oral health, enhance facial aesthetics, and, in fact, restore a patient’s functioning. In terms of alternative ways, implants court the alveolar bone, keeping bone resorption off and prospecting for the retention of facial aesthetics. These materials guide the wearer through these protocols carefully, so the patients can wear them as long as they want, and thus, the implants turn into permanent alternatives for lost teeth.</p>
